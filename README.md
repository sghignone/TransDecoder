The current build is based on the bioconda distribution of Brian Haas' transdecoder 5.5.0.

TransDecoder identifies candidate coding regions within transcript sequences, such as those generated by de novo RNA-Seq transcript assembly using Trinity, or constructed based on RNA-Seq alignments to the genome using Tophat and Cufflinks.
