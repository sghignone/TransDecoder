## TransDecoder

The current build is based on the bioconda distribution of Brian Haas' transdecoder 5.5.0.

TransDecoder identifies candidate coding regions within transcript sequences, such as those generated by de novo RNA-Seq transcript assembly using Trinity, or constructed based on RNA-Seq alignments to the genome using Tophat and Cufflinks.
